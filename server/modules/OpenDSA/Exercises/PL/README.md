# Source Directory for exercises in the OpenDSA Programming Languages book

The development effort is being coordinated by David Furcy (furcyd@uwosh.edu) and Tom Naps (naps@uwosh.edu)

# Current status of exercises

The following exercises still use the old-style RP (review problem
number) naming convention from when they were first developed by David
Furcy.  Presently none of these exercises are used in the version of
the book currently being used at UWOshkosh (PL.json).  However, they
are used in the "development" version of the book (PLdev.json).  The
next step in refining that development version is to rename these
exercises so they more appropirately reflect the topic they are
designed to provide practice with.
