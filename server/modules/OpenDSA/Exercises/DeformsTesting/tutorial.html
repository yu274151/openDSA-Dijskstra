            Welcome to the tutorial for the DEFORMS problem solving system!

        <p>
            We'll guide you through the basic steps on how to use this system to solve equations, submit answers, and get feedback.

        <h2>
            1. Getting started: The workspace
        </h2>
        <p>
            <div>
                <img src="img/wkspace.gif">
            </div>
            The workspace is the white area marked with "wkN" on the left side. This is where one adds all the equations from the equation bank to create a system of equations to solve.
            One can add more workspaces to create separate areas for trying out different variations of a problem, or delete entire workspaces to create a clean slate.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2. Adding equations and populating with values
        </h2>
        <p>
            <div>
                <img src="img/eqbank.gif">
            </div>
            To add an equation to a workspace, select the proper page of equations from the drop down menu on the right, and click on an equation. When it is highlighted, it is ready to be added.
            <div>
                <span>
                    <img src="img/eqbank2.gif">
                <!-- </div>
                <div> -->
                    <img src="img/eqbank3.gif">
                </span>
            </div>
            Then, click on the <b>Add</b> button for the workspace you want to add it to. A boxed version of the equation will appear. You can click on the boxes to bring up different options.
            <div>
                <img src="img/eqbox.gif">
            </div>
            To add a value from the question prose, click on the value box to highlight it,
            <div>
                <img src="img/value1.gif">
            </div>
            and then click on the box in the equation to place it in.
            <div>
                <img src="img/value2.gif">
            </div>
            Units of quantities can be changed by clicking on the unit part of the populated values to bring up a list of units to convert to.
            <div>
                <span>
                    <img src="img/unit1.gif">
                <!-- </div>
                <div> -->
                    <img src="img/unit2.gif">
                </span>
            </div>
            You can create simple arithmetic equations from the Arithmetic equations palette by adding values and associating variables, as outlined later.
        </p>

        <h2>
            3. Associating variables (for multivariable systems)
        </h2>
        <p>
            To create a system of equation with more than one variables, where the same variable appears in another equation, one needs to associate variables.
            This is done by clicking on an empty box in an equation, clicking on "start association" in the menu to highlight the box, then clicking on another empty box to associate it with.
            An example is as follows:
            <div>
                <img src="img/assoc1.gif">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="img/assoc2.gif">
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="img/assoc3.gif">
            </div>
        </p>

        <h2>
            4. Solving equations and submitting answers
        </h2>
        <p>
            To solve a system of equations, after you have populated the values and associated variables, click the check mark on the left side to select (&#x2611) the equation(s), and click on the "Solve button" for that workspace.
            <div>
                <img src="img/solve1.gif">
            </div>
            This will create a set of boxes with solutions for the system you created.
            <div>
                <img src="img/solve2.gif">
            </div>
            Click on this box once to highlight it, and then click on the yellow submission box for the question you are answering to submit this answer.
            <div>
                <img src="img/solve3.gif">
            </div>
            Some cases, you may have to click on a box to select a value from a menu to input. In both cases, the scissors can be clicked to clear the box.
        </p>

        <h2>
            5. Receiving feedback
        </h2>
        <p>
            The notifications panel on the right side shows errors for anything that may have happened with your system. Click on the errors to show more details about them.
            In some cases, clicking on the boxes will also show where in the equations an error has occurred.
            <span>
                <img src="img/feedback1.gif">
            <!-- </div> -->
