OpenDSA-LTI Web Interfaces
==========================

OpenDSA and the LMS
-------------------

OpenDSA now works in conjunction with a Learning Management System
(LMS).
Currently, OpenDSA LTI is confirmed to work with Canvas, Moodle, and Blackboard.
However, publishing complete books is only supported for Canvas.
All tasks related to class roll management, creating assignments from
exercises, due dates, and tracking scores and progress are done using
the standard tools provided by the LMS.
