The code in applicativeNormalOrderPRO.js that should have picked up
the normal order strategy was not working.  I'm not sure why, so that
still needs exploring.  To keep my Spring 2017 class afloat on an
emergency basis, I fixed the problem on a temporary basis using the
two files:

tempNormalOrderPRO.html
tempJustNormalOrderPRO.js

This shouldn't be viewed as a long-term fix, so when the problem gets
corrected, these two files should be deleted.
